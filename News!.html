    <h1>If I were queen for a day . . . by Caitlin Moran</h1>
  <h2>It's not all pomp and ceremony when our columnist becomes monarch. Though there are still a lot of crowns. And more unicorn horns than you might expect</h2>

  <p>At some point – when waiting in a supermarket checkout queue,
      or in a traffic jam, or while cleaning out the bin-juice from the bottom of a bin with a hose while wearing your slippers,
      miscalculating the velocity of the water, getting oomska-riddled bin-juice all over your legs,
      and feeling very aggrieved about the suboptimal way that life has turned out – we've all thought it.
      <i>“What would it be like if I were queen for the day? What would that be like? Would it be better than this?”</i></p>
      <p>“I'm just putting in a call about <b>a corgi</b>,” she said, “and you'd do yourself a favour by practising doing
        a tiny wave while looking a bit peeved – as if you've just seen the handles on your so-called
        "bag for life" snap after you've done a shop at the big Tesco. 
        You know, the Queen's typical face. <strong>GO!”</strong></p>
